Backward-backward chaining is a knowledge representation method which relies on backward-chaining to find a solution to a problem or reason about a set of propositions. A Backward-backward chaining algorithm takes as input a set of propositions containing the current state of the world, and produces an output set of propositions representing the next state of the world with respect to its goal and works backwards through all possible states to find this. It is based on the idea that by making backward-chaining a series of smaller goals it can prove its goal.

Backward-backward chaining is a decision-making method used in game-theory, automated theorem proving, and other applications where decision-making involves reasoning about state transitions.The theory of backward-chaining also provides a way to model and reason about information engines such as search engines pro","libVersion":"0.2.0"}
