The process of the DFS algorithm is as follows:In order to implement the DVS algorithm above using C++, we need to define a suitable data structure for storing nodes. We can use a stack data structure to move from one node to the next node and the greatest depth to it. It takes less time to reach to the goal node than BFS algorithm. It is also possible to use a queue instead of a stack to store nodes, but this may take longer to reach the goal node.In order to search for the DVS algorithm using C++, we need to define a suitable data structure to store nodes and their depth as well as a way to compare them in terms of depth. We can use a structure that stores the node data, its parent node's data, and its current depth. This allows us to quickly find the node with the smallest depth (i.e., the deepest goal) in order to find the shortest path. There is also a possibility that many states may be kept \"deep-down\" searching and there is no quantitative of finding the correct state on DVS algorithm's output.
