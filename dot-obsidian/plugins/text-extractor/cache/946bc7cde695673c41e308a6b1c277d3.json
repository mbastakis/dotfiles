The application has been deployed to Namespaces apx—gateway-staging and api-gateway-prod like this: kubectl kustomize /opt/cnurse/S/api—gateway/stag1ng | kubectl apply -f - kubectl kustomize /opt/course/S/api-gateway/prod | kubectl apply -f - Using the Kustomize config at /opt/cuurse/S/api-gateway do the following: 1. Remove the ConfigMap horizontal-sc’&ling—config completely 2. Add HPA named api-gateway for the Deployment api-gateway with min 2 and max 4 replicas. It should scale at 50% average CPU utilisation 3. In prod the HPA should have max 6 replicas 4. Apply your changes for staging and prod so they're reflected in the cluster","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
