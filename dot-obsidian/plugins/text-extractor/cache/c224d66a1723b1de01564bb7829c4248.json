The exam validates a candidate’s technical expertise in provisioning, operating, and managing distributed systems and services on AWS. The exam also validates a candidate’s ability to complete the following tasks: • Implement and manage continuous delivery systems and methodologies on AWS. • Implement and automate security controls, governance processes, and compliance validation. • Define and deploy monitoring, metrics, and logging systems on AWS. • Implement systems that are highly available, scalable, and self-healing on AWS. • Design, manage, and maintain tools to automate operational processes. Target candidate description The target candidate should have 2 or more years of experience in provisioning, operating, and managing AWS environments. The target candidate also has experience with the software development lifecycle and programming and/or scripting. Recommended general IT knowledge and experience The target candidate should have the following experience: • Experience in building highly automated infrastructure • Experience in administering operating systems • Experience with modern development and operations processes and methodologies Recommended AWS knowledge and experience The target candidate should have experience in securing AWS infrastructure. Version 1.4 DOP-C02 2 | PAGE Job tasks that are out of scope for the target candidate The following list contains job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be able to perform. This list is non-exhaustive. These tasks are out of scope for the exam: • Possess advanced networking knowledge (for example, advanced routing algorithms, failover techniques). • Provide deep-level security recommendations to developers. • Design, query, and optimize the performance of databases. • Develop full-stack application code. Refer to the Appendix for a list of technologies and concepts that might appear on the exam and a list of in-scope AWS services and features. Exam content Response types There are two types of questions on the exam: • Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors) • Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area. Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 65 questions that affect your score. Unscored content The exam includes 10 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam. Version 1.4 DOP-C02 3 | PAGE Exam results The AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional (DOP-C02) exam has a pass or fail designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines. Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum passing score is 750. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels. Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall exam. Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than other sections have. The table of classifications contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you interpret section-level feedback.
