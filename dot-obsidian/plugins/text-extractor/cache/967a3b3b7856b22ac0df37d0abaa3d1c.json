few questions © Stephane MaarekNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION © Stephane Maarek www.datacumulus.com What is CloudFormation • CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources (most of them are supported). • For example, within a CloudFormation template, you say: • I want a security group • I want two EC2 instances using this security group • I want an S3 bucket • I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines • Then CloudFormation creates those for you, in the right order, with the exact configuration that you specify © Stephane MaarekNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION © Stephane Maarek www.datacumulus.com Benefits of AWS CloudFormation (1/2) • Infrastructure as code • No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control • Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code • Cost • Each resources within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you • You can estimate the costs of your resources using the CloudFormation template • Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM, safely © Stephane MaarekNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION ©
