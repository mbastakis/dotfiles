Show that a rational agent’s action may depend not just on the state of the environment but also on the time step it has reached. 2.2 Let us examine the rationality of various vacuum-cleaner agent functions. a. Show that the simple vacuum-cleaner agent function described in Figure 2.3 is indeed rational under the assumptions listed on page 38. b. Describe a rational agent function for the case in which each movement costs one point. Does the corresponding agent program require internal state? ¢. Discuss possible agent designs for the cases in which clean squares can become dirty and the geography of the environment is unknown. Does it make sense for the agent to leam from its experience in these cases? If so, what should it learn? If not, why not? 2.3 For each of the following assertions, say whether it is true or false and support your answer with examples or counterexamples where appropriate. a. Anagent that senses only partial information about the state cannot be perfectly rational.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
