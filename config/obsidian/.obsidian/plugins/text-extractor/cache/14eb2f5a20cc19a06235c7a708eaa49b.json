Configure environment to only pull and run signed images 2. Configure network rules to restrict which Nodes can push and pul1l images 3. Configure repositories with RBAC rules 4. Developers build images using approved base images 5. Developers sign images and push to approved repos 6. Images are scanned for known vulnerabilities « Policies dictate whether images are promoted or quarantined based on scan results 7. Security team: « Reviews source code and scan results « Updates vulnerability rating as appropriate « Reviews container and Pod configuration files 8. Security team signs the image 9. All image pull and container run operations verify image signatures These steps are examples and not intended to represent an exact workflow. Let’s switch our focus away from images and CI/CD pipelines.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
