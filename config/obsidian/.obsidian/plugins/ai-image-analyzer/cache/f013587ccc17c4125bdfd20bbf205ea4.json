Breadth-first search traverses a tree or graph from its root node and then explores all of its child nodes before moving on to the grandchildren of those nodes. This differs from depth-first search which moves down the current level of the tree and visits all children before backtracking to explore a parent node. It's easier to understand the use of a breadth-first search algorithm. Breadth-first search is implemented using a queue data structure. The breadth-first search's main advantage is that it provides a solution in minimal number of steps, if there are more than one solutions for a given problem, then BFS will provide the minimum solution which requires the least number of steps. It's easy to implement and understand as well as efficient for trees and graphs with finite number of nodes.","libVersion":"0.2.0"}
