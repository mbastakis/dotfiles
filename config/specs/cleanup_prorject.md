# Repository Quality Cleanup & Standardization Specification

## Overview
A comprehensive specification for cleaning up and standardizing any Go-based repository with focus on code quality, testing, documentation, and architectural consistency. This spec provides a reusable framework for transforming repositories from inconsistent/broken state to production-ready quality.

## Requirements

### 1. Code Quality Standards
- **Static Analysis**: Zero staticcheck warnings

- **Linting**: Clean go vet output
- **Dependencies**: No unused imports or deprecated packages
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error message formatting (lowercase, no capitalization)
- **Interface Compliance**: All implementations properly satisfy their interfaces

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage for all core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing with proper build tags
- **Test Organization**: Consistent test file naming and structure
- **Test Reliability**: All tests must pass consistently
- **Coverage Reporting**: Minimum coverage thresholds defined

### 3. Documentation Standards
- **README**: Comprehensive project overview, setup, and usage
- **Development Guide**: CLAUDE.md or similar with architecture details
- **Code Comments**: Clear, concise inline documentation
- **Configuration Docs**: Complete configuration examples and templates
- **API Documentation**: Well-documented interfaces and public methods

### 4. Architecture Consistency
- **Interface Design**: Clean, consistent interfaces across modules
- **Configuration System**: Unified configuration management

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Run comprehensive quality assessment
   - Identify critical issues (build failures, test failures, interface problems)
   - Catalog code quality issues (staticcheck, formatting, deprecated usage)
   - Assess test coverage and gaps
   - Review documentation accuracy and completeness

2. **Priority Classification**
   - **Critical (High)**: Build failures, test failures, interface compliance
   - **High**: Staticcheck warnings, missing tests, major documentation gaps
   - **Medium**: Formatting issues, minor documentation updates
   - **Low**: Code style improvements, additional test coverage

3. **Task Planning**
   - Create todo list with prioritized tasks
   - Estimate effort for each category
   - Plan implementation order (critical issues first)

### Phase 2: Critical Issue Resolution
1. **Build System Fixes**
   - Resolve compilation errors
   - Fix import issues and dependency problems
   - Ensure all modules build successfully

2. **Interface Compliance**
   - Verify all implementations satisfy their interfaces
   - Fix method signature mismatches
   - Ensure consistent return types and error handling

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Fix failing tests
   - Add missing test files for core modules
   - Implement proper test isolation with build tags
   - Ensure test reliability and repeatability

### Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements
1. **Static Analysis Cleanup**
   - Fix all staticcheck warnings
   - Replace deprecated functions/packages
   - Address go vet issues
   - Implement proper error message formatting

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Run gofmt on all files
   - Ensure consistent code style
   - Fix any formatting-related issues

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Remove unused imports
   - Update deprecated dependencies
   - Clean up go.mod file

### Phase 4: Testing Enhancement
1. **Unit Test Creation**
   - Create comprehensive unit tests for all core modules
   - Focus on public interfaces and critical paths
   - Implement table-driven tests where appropriate
   - Add edge case and error condition testing

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Implement end-to-end integration tests
   - Use proper build tags for test isolation
   - Test critical user workflows
   - Ensure tests work in CI/CD environments

3. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Measure and report test coverage
   - Identify uncovered critical paths
   - Set and enforce minimum coverage thresholds

### Phase 5: Documentation & Polish
1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README with current functionality
   - Create or update development guide
   - Document configuration options and examples
   - Add inline code documentation

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Document key architectural decisions
   - Create development setup instructions
   - Document testing procedures
   - Add troubleshooting guides

## Quality Score Framework

Use this scoring system to track improvement:

### Critical Issues (1-10)

- **7-8**: Minor issues that don't affect core functionality
- **5-6**: Some test failures or build issues
- **3-4**: Significant problems affecting functionality
- **1-2**: Major build failures, most tests failing

### Code Quality (1-10)
- **9-10**: Zero staticcheck warnings, clean formatting
- **7-8**: Minor linting issues, mostly clean
- **5-6**: Some deprecated usage, formatting issues
- **3-4**: Multiple warnings, inconsistent style
- **1-2**: Many warnings, poor code quality

### Test Coverage (1-10)
- **9-10**: >80% coverage, comprehensive tests
- **7-8**: 60-80% coverage, good test coverage
- **5-6**: 40-60% coverage, basic tests
- **3-4**: 20-40% coverage, minimal tests
- **1-2**: <20% coverage, few or no tests

### Documentation (1-10)
- **9-10**: Comprehensive, accurate documentation
- **7-8**: Good documentation with minor gaps
- **5-6**: Basic documentation, some missing pieces
- **3-4**: Limited documentation, outdated
- **1-2**: Poor or missing documentation

### Architecture (1-10)

- **3-4**: Inconsistent patterns, needs improvement
- **1-2**: Poor architecture, major refactoring needed

## Notes

### Reusability Considerations
- This spec is designed to be language-agnostic in principle but provides Go-specific examples
- Adjust quality tools and commands for other languages (e.g., eslint for JavaScript, pytest for Python)
- Modify coverage thresholds based on project requirements and team standards
- Adapt documentation requirements to project needs and team conventions

### Best Practices
- Always fix critical issues before moving to code quality improvements
- Implement tests incrementally, focusing on critical paths first
- Use todo lists to track progress and maintain momentum
- Run quality checks frequently during the cleanup process
- Document decisions and trade-offs made during the cleanup

### Success Indicators
- Overall quality score improvement of 50%+ 
- All builds and tests passing consistently
- Team confidence in making changes without breaking functionality
- Reduced time spent on debugging and troubleshooting
- Improved developer experience and onboarding
