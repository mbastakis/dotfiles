# TODO Implementation Specification

## Purpose

This specification provides a structured approach for implementing a specific TODO item from a file containing multiple TODOs. It ensures focused, contextual, and systematic implementation of individual tasks without affecting other TODOs in the same file.

## Overview

When tasked with implementing a TODO, the agent must:
1. Identify and isolate the specific TODO requested
2. Understand its context within the repository
3. Gather all necessary information
4. Plan the implementation
5. Execute the implementation
6. Validate the solution

## Step 1: TODO Identification and Parsing

### 1.1 Locate the Specific TODO
- Read the TODO file completely
- Identify the exact TODO item requested by matching keywords or line numbers
- Extract the full context of the TODO, including:
  - The TODO title/summary
  - All description lines related to this TODO
  - Any code examples or error messages included
  - Stop when reaching the next TODO marker (usually `#TODO:` or similar)

### 1.2 Parse TODO Requirements
From the TODO content, identify:
- **Primary objective**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Specific requirements**: Listed constraints or features
- **Related files/paths**: Any mentioned files or directories
- **Error contexts**: If fixing an issue, understand the error
- **Expected outcomes**: What success looks like

## Step 2: Context Discovery

### 2.1 Identify Related Files
Based on the TODO content, determine which files to examine:
- Files explicitly mentioned in the TODO
- Configuration files that control the mentioned functionality
- Source code files for the features being modified
- Test files that validate the functionality
- Documentation that explains the current behavior

### 2.2 Read and Analyze Related Files
For each identified file:
- Read the current implementation
- Understand the code structure and patterns
- Note dependencies and imports
- Identify integration points
- Check for existing similar implementations

### 2.3 Understand the System Architecture
- How does this TODO fit into the larger system?
- What components will be affected?
- Are there established patterns to follow?
- What are the coding conventions?

## Step 3: Implementation Planning

### 3.1 Break Down the Task
Divide the TODO into smaller, manageable subtasks:
- List each file that needs to be created or modified
- Identify the order of implementation
- Note any dependencies between subtasks
- Consider potential edge cases

### 3.2 Design the Solution
- Choose appropriate design patterns
- Plan the code structure
- Consider error handling
- Think about future maintainability
- Ensure compatibility with existing code

### 3.3 Identify Risks and Mitigations
- What could go wrong?
- How to handle errors gracefully?
- What needs to be backed up?
- How to ensure rollback capability?

## Step 4: Implementation Execution

### 4.1 Pre-Implementation Checks
- Verify all prerequisite files exist
- Check current system state
- Ensure no conflicting changes
- Create backups if necessary

### 4.2 Implement in Order
Follow the planned subtasks:
1. Create new files (if needed)
2. Modify existing files
3. Update configurations
4. Add necessary imports/dependencies
5. Implement error handling
6. Add logging/debugging capabilities

### 4.3 Follow Project Conventions
- Match existing code style
- Use project-specific patterns
- Follow naming conventions
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Add appropriate comments (only if project style includes them)

## Step 5: Validation and Testing

### 5.1 Verify Implementation
- Check that all TODO requirements are met
- Ensure no regressions in existing functionality
- Validate error handling works correctly
- Confirm expected outputs/behaviors

### 5.2 Test the Changes
- Run existing tests to ensure nothing breaks
- Test the new functionality manually
- Verify edge cases are handled
- Check performance implications

### 5.3 Clean Up
- Remove any temporary files
- Update relevant documentation
- Ensure code is properly formatted
- Commit changes with clear messages

## Step 6: Implementation Report

### 6.1 Summary of Changes
Provide a clear summary including:
- Files created or modified
- Key implementation decisions
- Any deviations from the original TODO
- Potential improvements for future

### 6.2 Testing Results
- What was tested
- Test outcomes
- Any issues discovered
- Confidence level in the solution

### 6.3 Next Steps
- Any follow-up tasks needed
- Recommended improvements
- Documentation updates required
- Related TODOs that might be affected

## Common Patterns for Specific TODO Types

### Script Creation TODOs
When the TODO asks to create a script:
1. Understand the script's purpose and requirements
2. Check for similar scripts in the project
3. Follow project's script conventions
4. Make the script executable if required
5. Add to relevant configuration files
6. Test script execution thoroughly

### Bug Fix TODOs
When the TODO describes an error to fix:
1. Reproduce the error first
2. Understand the root cause
3. Research similar issues in the codebase
4. Implement the minimal fix needed
5. Verify the error is resolved
6. Check for side effects

### Configuration TODOs
When the TODO involves configuration changes:
1. Understand the configuration structure
2. Check for configuration schemas or validation
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Update related documentation
5. Test configuration loading
6. Verify dependent features still work

### Feature Addition TODOs
When the TODO requests a new feature:
1. Understand where the feature fits
2. Design the feature interface
3. Implement incrementally
4. Add necessary tests
5. Update relevant documentation
6. Consider user experience

## Error Handling Guidelines

- Always validate inputs
- Provide clear error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Fail gracefully
- Maintain system stability
- Document error scenarios

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with the minimum viable implementation
2. **Test Often**: Validate each step before proceeding
3. **Keep Changes Focused**: Don't fix unrelated issues
4. **Document Decisions**: Explain why, not just what
5. **Consider Maintenance**: Write code that others can understand
6. **Be Conservative**: When in doubt, preserve existing behavior
