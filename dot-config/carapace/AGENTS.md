# Carapace Shell Completions

Multi-shell completion system using specs and bridges.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Auto-generated? |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `specs/bw.yaml` | Native spec for Bitwarden CLI | **No** - hand-written (~300 lines) |
| `specs/opencode.yaml` | Yargs bridge for OpenCode | Yes - via `carapace-sync` |
| `specs/obsidian-cli.yaml` | Cobra bridge for Obsidian CLI | Yes - via `carapace-sync` |
| `tools.yaml` | Registry of managed tools | Manual (in git) |
| `config.yaml` | Catppuccin Mocha theme | Manual (in git) |
| `.versions` | Version cache for change detection | Auto-generated (tracked in git) |

## Commands

```bash
carapace-sync              # Sync all (updates only if version changed)
carapace-sync --force      # Force regenerate all bridge specs
carapace-sync --add <tool> # Add new tool to registry
carapace-sync --list       # Show managed tools and status
carapace-sync --test       # Verify specs work correctly
```

## Spec Types

### Bridge Specs (auto-generated)

For tools with framework completion support. Generated by `carapace-sync`:

```yaml
name: opencode
description: AI coding assistant CLI
parsing: disabled
completion:
  positionalany: ["$carapace.bridge.Yargs([opencode])"]
```

### Native Specs (manual)

For tools without framework support or needing custom completion. **Must be maintained by hand.**

`bw.yaml` is a native spec because Bitwarden CLI's zsh completion doesn't work well with bridges. It defines all flags, subcommands, and positional completions manually. If deleted, it must be recreated by:
1. Running `bw --help` and subcommand help
2. Translating to carapace YAML spec format
3. Testing with `carapace bw zsh | head` and actual TAB completion

## Bridge Type Selection

Match bridge to the tool's completion framework - check output of `<tool> completion`:

| Framework | Identifier Pattern | Bridge Macro |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Yargs | "yargs command completion script" | `$carapace.bridge.Yargs([tool])` |
| Cobra | `shellCompDirective` variables | `$carapace.bridge.Cobra([tool])` |
| Native zsh | `_arguments`, `compdef` | `$carapace.bridge.Zsh([tool])` or native spec |

## Gotchas

- **`.versions` must be tracked in git** - if gitignored, `carapace-sync` regenerates specs on every run (cached version is empty → always differs from current)
- **`carapace export` returns empty even when working** - don't use for debugging; test with actual TAB completion
- **Built-in completers (669+) override custom specs** - check `carapace --list | grep <tool>` before creating specs; tools like `bun`, `git`, `docker` don't need specs
- **Zsh shell bridges require setup** - register completions in `bridge/zsh/.zshrc` with both `eval` and explicit `compdef`
- **Version matters** - bridges broken in 1.5.5, fixed in 1.6.0+
- **bw.yaml is NOT auto-generated** - it's a 300-line native spec; handle with care

## Startup Performance

Carapace init is cached at `~/.cache/carapace-init.zsh` (gitignored). Cache invalidates when carapace binary changes. No completion generation happens at shell startup - all specs are pre-generated.
