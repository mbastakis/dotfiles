- Apply search algorithms (BFS/DFS) to find optimal solution paths
**When to Use**: For complex problem-solving requiring systematic exploration

### Hindsight is 20/20: The 'If Only...' Reflection
**Purpose**: Learn from imagined future scenarios
**Method**:
- Imagine retrospective scenario based on current content
- Identify the one "if only we had known/done X..." insight
- Describe imagined consequences humorously or dramatically
- Extract actionable learnings for current context
**When to Use**: For risk mitigation and learning from potential futures

## Multi-Persona Collaboration Methods

### Agile Team Perspective Shift
**Purpose**: Gather insights from different team roles
**Method**: Rotate through different Scrum team member viewpoints:
- **Product Owner**: Focus on user value and business impact
- **Scrum Master**: Examine process flow and team dynamics
- **Developer**: Assess technical implementation and complexity
- **QA**: Identify testing scenarios and quality concerns
**When to Use**: When comprehensive team perspective is needed

### Stakeholder Round Table
**Purpose**: Simulate multi-stakeholder discussions
**Method**:
- Convene virtual meeting with multiple personas
- Each persona contributes unique perspective on content
- Identify conflicts and synergies between viewpoints
- Synthesize insights into actionable recommendations
**When to Use**: For complex decisions affecting multiple stakeholders

### Meta-Prompting Analysis
**Purpose**: Optimize the elicitation process itself
**Method**:
- Step back to analyze the structure and logic of current approach
- Question the format and methodology being used
- Suggest alternative frameworks or mental models
- Optimize the elicitation process itself
**When to Use**: When current methods aren't yielding good results

## Advanced 2025 Techniques

### Self-Consistency Validation
**Purpose**: Increase reliability through multiple approaches
**Method**:
- Generate multiple reasoning paths for same problem
- Compare consistency across different approaches
- Identify most reliable and robust solution
- Highlight areas where approaches diverge and why
**When to Use**: For critical decisions requiring high confidence

### ReWOO (Reasoning Without Observation)
**Purpose**: Optimize efficiency by separating reasoning from tool use
**Method**:
- Separate parametric reasoning from tool-based actions
- Create reasoning plan without external dependencies
- Identify what can be solved through pure reasoning
- Optimize for efficiency and reduced token usage
**When to Use**: When efficiency and speed are priorities

### Persona-Pattern Hybrid
**Purpose**: Combine role expertise with elicitation patterns
**Method**: Combine specific role expertise with elicitation pattern:
- **Architect + Risk Analysis**: Deep technical risk assessment
- **UX Expert + User Journey**: End-to-end experience critique
- **PM + Stakeholder Analysis**: Multi-perspective impact review
**When to Use**: When deep domain expertise is needed for elicitation

### Emergent Collaboration Discovery
**Purpose**: Discover unexpected insights through natural interaction
**Method**:
- Allow multiple perspectives to naturally emerge
- Identify unexpected insights from persona interactions
- Explore novel combinations of viewpoints
- Capture serendipitous discoveries from multi-agent thinking
**When to Use**: For innovation and breakthrough thinking

## Game-Based Elicitation Methods

### Red Team vs Blue Team
**Purpose**: Strengthen proposals through adversarial testing
**Method**:
- **Red Team**: Attack the proposal, find vulnerabilities
- **Blue Team**: Defend and strengthen the approach
- Competitive analysis reveals blind spots
- Results in more robust, battle-tested solutions
**When to Use**: For security analysis and proposal strengthening

### Innovation Tournament
**Purpose**: Compare and improve multiple alternatives
**Method**:
- Pit multiple alternative approaches against each other
- Score each approach across different criteria
- Crowd-source evaluation from different personas
