## Core Methodology

BMad (Business Methodology for Agile Development) is a comprehensive framework that bridges business requirements with technical implementation through structured elicitation, analysis, and development processes.

### Key Principles

1. **Iterative Elicitation**: Requirements are discovered through progressive refinement
2. **Cross-functional Collaboration**: All stakeholders participate in the development process
3. **Quality Gates**: Each deliverable must pass defined quality checkpoints
4. **Traceability**: Clear links between business needs and technical solutions
5. **Adaptive Planning**: Plans evolve based on discovered information

## Project Types

### Greenfield Projects
- **Definition**: New projects starting from scratch
- **Characteristics**:
  - No existing codebase constraints
  - Full architectural freedom
  - Complete requirements discovery needed
  - Higher uncertainty and risk
- **Approach**: Start with project brief, then architecture, then stories

### Brownfield Projects
- **Definition**: Projects working with existing systems
- **Characteristics**:
  - Existing codebase and architecture
  - Legacy constraints and dependencies
  - Partial requirements known
  - Integration challenges
- **Approach**: Start with technical analysis, then stories

## Workflow Patterns

### Story Development Lifecycle
1. **Elicitation**: Gather initial requirements
2. **Analysis**: Break down into manageable pieces
3. **Design**: Create technical and UX specifications
4. **Implementation**: Develop and test
5. **Validation**: Verify against acceptance criteria
6. **Deployment**: Release to production

### Quality Gates
- **Story Draft**: Initial story meets basic criteria
- **Story Refinement**: Story is detailed and estimated
- **Definition of Done**: Story meets all completion criteria
- **Architecture Review**: Technical design is sound
- **Change Management**: Changes are properly assessed
