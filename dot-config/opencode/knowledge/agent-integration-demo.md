# Cache and Logging Agents Integration Demo

## 🎯 **Demonstration: How the Agents Work**

Let me show you how the cache manager, session manager, and performance monitor agents work seamlessly within OpenCode conversations.

## 🗂️ **Cache Manager in Action**

### **Example 1: Starting Your Day**
```bash
User: @cache-manager Populate cache with current project context

Cache Manager Response:
🔄 Populating OpenCode cache with current project context...

[Runs: ~/.config/opencode/cache/cache-helper.sh populate]

✅ Cache populated successfully!
📊 Cache Status:
- BMad methodology: Cached (1.0KB)
- Coding standards: Cached (1.3KB) 
- Security standards: Cached (1.7KB)
- Project patterns: Cached (web-app patterns, 2.1KB)

🎯 Performance Impact:
- Context loading will be ~60% faster
- Token usage reduced by estimated 40%
- Cache hit rate target: 80%

💡 Recommendation: Cache is optimized for web application development. 
   Run this command weekly or when switching project types.
```

### **Example 2: Checking Cache Performance**
```bash
User: @cache-manager Show cache status and performance metrics

Cache Manager Response:
📊 OpenCode Cache Status:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📁 Cached files: 4
💾 Cache size: 6.1KB / 100MB (0.006%)
🎯 Cache hit rate: 85% (exceeds 80% target)
⚡ Average cache response: 0.2s

📋 Cached Content:
• bmad-methodology-cached.md (1.0KB) - Fresh
• coding-standards-cached.md (1.3KB) - Fresh  
• security-standards-cached.md (1.7KB) - Fresh
• project-patterns-cached.md (2.1KB) - Fresh

✅ Cache Health: Excellent
💡 Next optimization: Consider caching API patterns if working with backend services
```

## 📋 **Session Manager in Action**

### **Example 1: Starting Session Tracking**
```bash
User: @session-manager Start session logging for today's development work

Session Manager Response:
🚀 Starting comprehensive session tracking...

[Runs: ~/.config/opencode/logs/session-logger.sh start]

✅ Session logging initialized!
📊 Session Details:
- Session ID: 28451
- Start Time: Mon Aug 3 10:15:23 EEST 2025
- Project Type: Web Application (auto-detected)
- Working Directory: /Users/mbastakis/dev/dotfiles

📈 Tracking Enabled:
- Agent usage patterns
- Performance metrics
- Productivity indicators
- Development workflow

💡 Tip: I'll automatically log agent usage as you work. 
   Use '@session-manager Show status' to check progress anytime.
```

### **Example 2: Checking Session Progress**
```bash
User: @session-manager Show current session status and productivity metrics

Session Manager Response:
📊 Current Session Status:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔄 Session ID: 28451
⏱️ Duration: 2h 15m
📁 Project: Web Application
👤 User: mbastakis

🤖 Agent Usage (Last 2 hours):
• @bmad-master: 3 times (requirements, architecture)
• @context-primer: 1 time (project analysis)
• @system-architect: 2 times (design work)
• @cache-manager: 1 time (optimization)

📈 Productivity Metrics:
• Average response time: 1.8s
• Tasks completed: 5
• Agent coordination: 92% efficiency
• Session productivity: High

💡 Most productive pattern: bmad-master → system-architect → senior-developer
```

## 📈 **Performance Monitor in Action**

### **Example 1: System Performance Check**
```bash
User: @performance-monitor Show current system performance metrics

Performance Monitor Response:
📊 OpenCode System Performance Dashboard:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 Key Performance Indicators:
| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Response Time | 1.8s | <2s | ✅ |
| Cache Hit Rate | 85% | >80% | ✅ |
| Agent Success | 98% | >95% | ✅ |
| Context Loading | 1.2s | <1.5s | ✅ |

📈 Performance Trends (Last 7 days):
• Response time: Improved 15%
• Cache efficiency: Increased 8%
• Agent coordination: Stable at 92%
• Token usage: Reduced 35%

🔍 System Health: Excellent
💡 Recommendation: Performance is optimal. Consider enabling predictive caching for further improvements.
```

### **Example 2: Performance Optimization**
```bash
User: @performance-monitor Analyze performance and suggest optimizations

Performance Monitor Response:
🔍 Performance Analysis Complete:

📊 Current Performance Assessment:
✅ Overall system health: Excellent (95/100)
✅ Response times: Within targets
✅ Cache efficiency: Above targets
⚠️ Opportunity identified: Context loading optimization

🎯 Optimization Recommendations:

1. **High Impact, Low Effort:**
   - Enable predictive context loading (+10% performance)
   - Optimize spec layer caching (+5% cache hits)

2. **Medium Impact, Medium Effort:**
   - Implement context compression (+15% token efficiency)
   - Enhanced agent coordination (+8% efficiency)

3. **Performance Forecast:**
   - With optimizations: 25% faster context loading
   - Estimated token savings: Additional 20%
   - User experience: Significantly improved

💡 Next Steps: 
1. @cache-manager optimize cache for predictive loading
2. Monitor improvements over next week
3. Implement context compression if needed
```

## 🔄 **Integrated Workflow Example**

### **Complete Development Session**
```bash
# Morning startup
User: @session-manager Start session for authentication feature development
User: @cache-manager Populate cache with web application patterns

# Development work
User: @bmad-master I want to create OAuth2 authentication for my React app
# Session manager automatically logs this usage

User: @system-architect Design secure authentication architecture
# Session manager automatically logs this usage

# Check progress
User: @session-manager Show progress on authentication development
User: @performance-monitor Check system performance during development

# End of day
User: @session-manager End session and generate productivity report
User: @performance-monitor Generate daily performance summary
```
