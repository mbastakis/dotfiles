# Brainstorming Techniques for Business Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive collection of brainstorming techniques that can be used by the Business Analyst agent for creative ideation, problem-solving, and strategic thinking.

## Creative Expansion Techniques

### 1. What If Scenarios
**Purpose**: Explore possibilities through provocative questioning
**Method**: Ask one provocative question, get their response, then ask another
**Example**: "What if users could only access this feature once per day? How would that change their behavior?"

### 2. Analogical Thinking
**Purpose**: Generate ideas by drawing parallels to other domains
**Method**: Give one example analogy, ask them to find 2-3 more
**Example**: "If this app were a restaurant, what type would it be? Now think of 2 more analogies."

### 3. Reversal/Inversion
**Purpose**: Uncover insights by examining the opposite
**Method**: Pose the reverse question, let them work through it
**Example**: "Instead of helping users save time, what if we made them spend more time? What would that reveal?"

### 4. First Principles Thinking
**Purpose**: Break down complex problems to fundamental truths
**Method**: Ask "What are the fundamentals?" and guide them to break it down
**Example**: "What are the absolute core elements that must exist for this solution to work?"

## Structured Frameworks

### 5. SCAMPER Method
**Purpose**: Systematic creative thinking through structured prompts
**Method**: Go through one letter at a time, wait for their ideas before moving to next
- **S**ubstitute: What can be substituted?
- **C**ombine: What can be combined?
- **A**dapt: What can be adapted?
- **M**odify: What can be modified or magnified?
- **P**ut to other uses: How else can this be used?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed?
- **R**everse: What can be rearranged or reversed?

### 6. Six Thinking Hats
**Purpose**: Explore different perspectives systematically
**Method**: Present one hat, ask for their thoughts, then move to next hat
- **White Hat**: Facts and information
- **Red Hat**: Emotions and feelings
- **Black Hat**: Critical judgment
- **Yellow Hat**: Positive assessment
- **Green Hat**: Creativity and alternatives
- **Blue Hat**: Process control

### 7. Mind Mapping
**Purpose**: Visual exploration of ideas and connections
**Method**: Start with central concept, ask them to suggest branches
**Example**: "Let's put 'User Onboarding' in the center. What are the main branches you see?"

## Collaborative Techniques

### 8. "Yes, And..." Building
**Purpose**: Build on ideas without judgment
**Method**: They give idea, you "yes and" it, they "yes and" back - alternate
**Example**: "User wants quick signup" → "Yes, and they want social login" → "Yes, and they want to skip email verification"

### 9. Brainwriting/Round Robin
**Purpose**: Structured idea building
**Method**: They suggest idea, you build on it, ask them to build on yours
**Example**: Written or verbal exchange of building on each other's concepts

### 10. Random Stimulation
**Purpose**: Break mental patterns with unexpected connections
**Method**: Give one random prompt/word, ask them to make connections
**Example**: "How does 'bicycle' relate to user authentication?"

## Deep Exploration Techniques

### 11. Five Whys
**Purpose**: Uncover root causes and deeper motivations
**Method**: Ask "why" and wait for their answer before asking next "why"
**Example**: 
- "Why do users abandon the signup process?"
- "Because it's too long"
- "Why is it too long?"
- "Because we ask for too much information"
- "Why do we ask for so much information?"
- Continue...

### 12. Morphological Analysis
**Purpose**: Systematic exploration of solution combinations
**Method**: Ask them to list parameters first, then explore combinations together
**Example**: "List all the ways users could authenticate (parameters), then let's combine them in new ways"

### 13. Provocation Technique (PO)
**Purpose**: Generate breakthrough ideas through deliberate provocation
**Method**: Give one provocative statement, ask them to extract useful ideas
**Example**: "PO: Users must pay before they can see what they're buying. What useful ideas does this spark?"

## Advanced Techniques

### 14. Forced Relationships
**Purpose**: Create unexpected connections between unrelated concepts
**Method**: Connect two unrelated concepts and ask them to find the bridge
**Example**: "How is user onboarding like making coffee? Find the connections."

### 15. Assumption Reversal
**Purpose**: Challenge fundamental assumptions
**Method**: Challenge their core assumptions and ask them to build from there
**Example**: "You assume users want to save time. What if they actually want to spend more time?"

### 16. Role Playing
**Purpose**: Explore different stakeholder perspectives
**Method**: Ask them to brainstorm from different stakeholder perspectives
**Example**: "How would a 70-year-old user approach this? A teenager? A busy parent?"

### 17. Time Shifting
**Purpose**: Explore solutions across different time periods
**Method**: "How would you solve this in 1995? 2030?"
**Example**: "If this problem existed in 1995, how would it be solved? What about in 2030?"

### 18. Resource Constraints
**Purpose**: Force creative solutions through artificial limitations
**Method**: "What if you had only $10 and 1 hour?"
**Example**: "Design a user onboarding process with only $10 budget and 1 hour of development time"

### 19. Metaphor Mapping
**Purpose**: Use extended metaphors to explore solutions
**Method**: Use extended metaphors to explore solutions
**Example**: "If user onboarding is a journey, what kind of journey is it? A hike? A cruise? A race?"

### 20. Question Storming
**Purpose**: Generate questions instead of answers first
**Method**: Generate questions instead of answers first
**Example**: "Instead of solutions, let's generate 20 questions about user onboarding"

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Use Each Technique

**For Problem Definition:**
- Five Whys
- First Principles Thinking
- Assumption Reversal

**For Solution Generation:**
- SCAMPER Method
- Random Stimulation
- Forced Relationships

**For Perspective Expansion:**
- Six Thinking Hats
- Role Playing
- Time Shifting

**For Idea Development:**
- "Yes, And..." Building
- Mind Mapping
- Morphological Analysis

### Best Practices

1. **Set Clear Objectives**: Define what you want to achieve before starting
2. **Create Safe Space**: Encourage wild ideas without immediate judgment
3. **Build on Ideas**: Use "Yes, and..." instead of "Yes, but..."
4. **Defer Judgment**: Separate idea generation from evaluation
5. **Encourage Quantity**: More ideas lead to better ideas
6. **Stay Focused**: Keep sessions focused on the specific challenge
7. **Document Everything**: Capture all ideas for later evaluation
8. **Follow Up**: Plan next steps for promising ideas

### Session Structure

1. **Warm-up** (5 minutes): Simple creative exercise
2. **Problem Framing** (10 minutes): Clearly define the challenge
3. **Idea Generation** (20-30 minutes): Apply chosen technique(s)
4. **Idea Clustering** (10 minutes): Group related ideas
5. **Initial Evaluation** (10 minutes): Identify most promising concepts
6. **Next Steps** (5 minutes): Plan follow-up actions

### Combining Techniques

Many techniques work well in combination:
- Start with **Five Whys** to understand the problem, then use **SCAMPER** for solutions
- Use **Role Playing** to generate perspectives, then **Mind Mapping** to organize ideas
- Apply **Random Stimulation** for breakthrough thinking, then **"Yes, And..."** to develop ideas

### Digital Tools Integration

While these techniques are designed for human-AI collaboration, they can be enhanced with:
- Digital mind mapping tools
- Collaborative whiteboards
- Idea management platforms
- Documentation systems

Remember: The goal is not just to generate ideas, but to generate *useful* ideas that can be developed into actionable solutions for the business challenge at hand.
