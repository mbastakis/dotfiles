# OAuth2 Knowledge Curation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides systematic procedures for maintaining, updating, and evolving the OAuth2 knowledge base to ensure it remains current, accurate, and valuable for institutional learning.

## Knowledge Curation Framework

### 1. Content Lifecycle Management

#### 1.1 Content Creation Standards

**New Content Requirements:**
- Must align with established taxonomy structure
- Requires technical accuracy validation
- Must include practical examples
- Should reference authoritative sources (RFCs, security advisories)

**Content Creation Process:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Identify Need] --> B[Research & Draft]
    B --> C[Technical Review]
    C --> D[Expert Validation]
    D --> E[Integration Testing]
    E --> F[Publication]
    F --> G[Feedback Collection]
```

#### 1.2 Content Update Triggers

**Immediate Updates Required:**
- Critical security vulnerabilities discovered
- New RFC publications affecting OAuth2
- Breaking changes in major implementations

**Scheduled Updates:**
- Monthly: Security advisory reviews
- Quarterly: Comprehensive content audit
- Annually: Learning effectiveness assessment

#### 1.3 Content Retirement Criteria

**Content should be retired when:**
- Superseded by newer standards
- No longer considered secure practice
- Implementation patterns become obsolete
- Learner feedback indicates confusion or errors

### 2. Quality Assurance Process

#### 2.1 Technical Accuracy Validation

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All code examples tested in current environments
- [ ] RFC references current and accurate
- [ ] Security recommendations align with latest best practices
- [ ] Implementation patterns verified with real-world usage

**Validation Tools:**
```bash
# Automated validation script example
#!/bin/bash

# Validate OAuth2 code examples
echo "Validating OAuth2 implementations..."

# Check for deprecated patterns
grep -r "implicit.*flow" knowledge/ && echo "WARNING: Implicit flow detected"

# Validate PKCE implementations
grep -r "code_challenge" knowledge/ || echo "ERROR: PKCE examples missing"

# Check for security best practices
grep -r "localStorage.*token" knowledge/ && echo "WARNING: Insecure token storage"

echo "Validation complete"
```

#### 2.2 Learning Effectiveness Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of learners completing each level
- **Assessment Scores**: Average scores on knowledge assessments
- **Implementation Success**: Success rate of real-world implementations
- **Time to Competency**: Average time to achieve proficiency

**Measurement Framework:**
```yaml
metrics_collection:
  learning_analytics:
    completion_tracking: true
    assessment_scoring: true
    time_tracking: true
    feedback_collection: true
  
  implementation_tracking:

    security_incident_correlation: true
  
  content_effectiveness:
    engagement_metrics: true
    comprehension_assessment: true
    practical_application_success: true
```

### 3. Knowledge Organization and Discoverability

#### 3.1 Taxonomy Maintenance

**Taxonomy Evolution Process:**
1. **Quarterly Review**: Assess current taxonomy effectiveness

  prerequisites: ["required", "knowledge"]
  duration: "estimated learning time"
  last_updated: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  version: "semantic version"
  author: "content creator"
  reviewer: "technical reviewer"
```

**Tagging Strategy:**
- **Functional Tags**: authentication, authorization, security
