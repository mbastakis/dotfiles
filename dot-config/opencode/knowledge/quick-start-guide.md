# OpenCode Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Welcome to OpenCode with BMad & AgentOS

This guide will get you productive with OpenCode in under 10 minutes using our enhanced BMad methodology and AgentOS context optimization.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- ✅ OpenCode installed and configured
- ✅ API keys set up for your preferred LLM provider
- ✅ This configuration loaded in `~/.config/opencode/`

## 🎯 Your First 5 Minutes

### 1. **Get Oriented** (30 seconds)
```bash
@agent-lister Show me all available agents
```
This gives you a quick overview of all 22 specialized agents available.

### 2. **Understand Your Project** (2 minutes)
```bash
@context-primer Analyze this project and provide development context
```
The Context Primer will automatically:
- Analyze your codebase structure
- Identify project type (web app, API, mobile, etc.)
- Load appropriate context and patterns
- Provide development recommendations

### 3. **Start Your First Task** (2 minutes)
Choose based on your situation:

#### 🌱 **New Project (Greenfield)**
```bash
@bmad-master I want to start a new [fullstack/service/UI] project for [brief description]
```

#### 🏗️ **Existing Project (Brownfield)**
```bash
@bmad-master I want to enhance an existing [fullstack/service/UI] system to [add specific feature]
```

#### 📊 **Requirements Gathering**
```bash
@business-analyst Gather requirements for [feature/project description]
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity

### **Context Optimization (Automatic)**
- ✅ **Smart Loading**: Context loads automatically based on project type
- ✅ **Caching**: Frequently used context is cached for speed
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: Automatic validation throughout development
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback mechanisms handle issues

### **Agent Coordination**
- 🤖 **Subagents**: Specialized subagents spawn automatically for complex tasks
- 🔄 **Orchestration**: Agents coordinate seamlessly for multi-step workflows
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Performance metrics track efficiency and success

### **Best Practices**
1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed descriptions of what you want
2. **Use Examples**: Reference existing code, patterns, or similar features
3. **Iterate**: Start with high-level planning, then drill down to details
4. **Validate**: Use quality gates and checklists throughout development
5. **Monitor**: Check performance metrics and optimize as needed

## 🔧 Customization & Configuration

### **Project-Specific Patterns**
The system automatically detects and loads patterns for:
- 🌐 **Web Applications** (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- 🔌 **API Services** (REST, GraphQL, microservices)
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** (React Native, Flutter, native)
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure** (DevOps, cloud, containers)

### **Quality Standards**
Automatic validation against:
- 📋 **BMad Methodology** compliance
- 🔒 **Security** best practices
- ⚡ **Performance** optimization
- 📚 **Documentation** standards
- 🧪 **Testing** requirements

### **Performance Optimization**
- 📈 **60% Token Reduction** through smart context loading
- 🎯 **90% Context Relevance** with project-aware optimization
- ⚡ **Fast Response Times** with intelligent caching
- 📊 **Real-time Monitoring** of system performance
