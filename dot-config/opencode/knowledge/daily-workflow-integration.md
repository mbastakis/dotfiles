# Daily OpenCode Workflow with Cache and Logging Integration

## ðŸš€ **Seamless Daily Workflow**

Now that we have dedicated agents to manage cache and logging, here's how to integrate them into your daily OpenCode workflow **without any terminal commands**.

## ðŸŒ… **Morning Startup Routine (2 minutes)**

### **1. Start Your Development Day**
```bash
# Initialize your development session
@session-manager Start session logging for today's development work

# Populate cache for optimal performance
@cache-manager Populate cache with current project context

# Check system health
@performance-monitor Show current system performance and health status
```

**What happens automatically:**
- âœ… Session tracking begins with project context detection
- âœ… Cache populated with BMad methodology, coding standards, security guidelines
- âœ… Performance baseline established for the day
- âœ… System health validated

## ðŸ’» **During Development (Seamless Integration)**

### **2. Normal OpenCode Usage with Automatic Logging**
```bash
# Use agents normally - logging happens automatically
@bmad-master I want to create requirements for user authentication feature
# Session manager automatically logs: bmad-master usage for requirements creation

@context-primer Analyze this project structure and provide development context
# Session manager automatically logs: context-primer usage for project analysis

@system-architect Design architecture for microservices authentication
# Session manager automatically logs: system-architect usage for architecture design
```

### **3. Check Progress and Performance (As Needed)**
```bash
# Check current session progress
@session-manager Show current session status and productivity metrics

# Monitor cache efficiency
@cache-manager Show cache status and performance metrics

# Check system performance
@performance-monitor Show real-time performance metrics
```

### **4. Optimize Performance (When Needed)**
```bash
# If things feel slow
@cache-manager Optimize cache for current project type

# If you want performance insights
@performance-monitor Analyze performance and suggest optimizations

# If you want to see usage patterns
@session-manager Show agent usage patterns for this session
```

## ðŸŒ† **End of Day Routine (1 minute)**

### **5. Wrap Up Your Development Session**
```bash
# End session and get productivity report
@session-manager End session and generate productivity report

# Check cache efficiency for tomorrow
@cache-manager Show cache status and optimization recommendations

# Get performance summary
@performance-monitor Generate daily performance summary
```

**What you get automatically:**
- âœ… Complete session productivity report
- âœ… Agent usage analytics and patterns
- âœ… Performance metrics and trends
- âœ… Cache efficiency analysis
- âœ… Recommendations for tomorrow

## ðŸ“Š **Weekly Optimization (5 minutes)**

### **6. Weekly Performance Review**
```bash
# Analyze weekly productivity patterns
@session-manager Generate weekly usage report and productivity analysis

# Review cache performance
@cache-manager Analyze weekly cache performance and optimization opportunities

# Check system performance trends
@performance-monitor Analyze weekly performance trends and suggest improvements
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Real-World Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Starting a New Feature**
```bash
# Morning setup
@session-manager Start session for new authentication feature development
@cache-manager Ensure cache is optimized for web application patterns

# Development work
@bmad-master I want to create a new authentication feature for my web app
@business-analyst Gather requirements for OAuth2 authentication
@system-architect Design secure authentication architecture
@senior-developer Implement OAuth2 authentication following best practices

# Check progress
@session-manager Show progress on authentication feature development
@performance-monitor Check if system performance is optimal

# End of day
@session-manager End session and show productivity metrics for authentication work
```

### **Example 2: Debugging Performance Issues**
```bash
# Notice slow performance
@performance-monitor Analyze current system performance and identify bottlenecks

# Check cache efficiency
@cache-manager Show cache hit rates and identify optimization opportunities

# Optimize if needed
@cache-manager Clear cache and rebuild with fresh context
@performance-monitor Monitor performance improvement after cache optimization

# Log the optimization
@session-manager Log performance optimization activity and results
```

### **Example 3: Weekly Team Review**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive reports
@session-manager Generate weekly team productivity report
@performance-monitor Create weekly performance analysis
@cache-manager Show weekly cache efficiency trends

# Share insights
@performance-monitor Identify top productivity patterns and optimization opportunities
@session-manager Show most effective agent combinations and workflows
```

## ðŸ”„ **Automatic Background Operations**

### **What Happens Automatically (No User Action Required):**

1. **Session Tracking**
   - âœ… Agent usage automatically logged
   - âœ… Performance metrics collected
   - âœ… Productivity patterns tracked

2. **Cache Management**
   - âœ… Cache health monitored
   - âœ… Performance impact tracked
   - âœ… Optimization opportunities identified

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - âœ… System metrics collected continuously
   - âœ… Trends analyzed automatically
   - âœ… Issues detected proactively

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity**

### **Daily Habits**
1. **Always start with session manager** - Get the full productivity benefits
2. **Check cache status weekly** - Ensure optimal performance
3. **Review performance trends monthly** - Identify long-term optimizations

### **Performance Optimization**
1. **Use cache manager when switching projects** - Optimize for new context
2. **Monitor performance during heavy work** - Catch issues early
3. **End sessions properly** - Get valuable productivity insights

### **Productivity Insights**
1. **Review weekly reports** - Understand your productivity patterns
2. **Optimize based on data** - Use metrics to improve workflow
3. **Share insights with team** - Improve collective productivity
