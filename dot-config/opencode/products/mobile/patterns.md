# Mobile Application Development Patterns

## Overview
Comprehensive patterns and best practices for mobile application development, covering native iOS/Android, cross-platform frameworks, and mobile-specific considerations.

## Architecture Patterns

### Native Mobile Architecture
```yaml
architecture_type: "native_mobile"
platforms:
  ios:
    language: "Swift"
    architecture: "MVVM"
    frameworks: ["UIKit", "SwiftUI", "Combine"]
    patterns: ["Coordinator", "Repository", "Dependency Injection"]
  android:
    language: "Kotlin"
    architecture: "MVVM"
    frameworks: ["Jetpack Compose", "Android Architecture Components"]
    patterns: ["Repository", "ViewModel", "LiveData/StateFlow"]
```

### Cross-Platform Architecture
```yaml
architecture_type: "cross_platform"
frameworks:
  react_native:
    language: "TypeScript"
    state_management: ["Redux Toolkit", "Zustand", "Context API"]
    navigation: "React Navigation"
    patterns: ["Component Composition", "Custom Hooks", "Provider Pattern"]
  flutter:
    language: "Dart"
    architecture: "BLoC"
    state_management: ["BLoC", "Provider", "Riverpod"]
    patterns: ["Repository", "Service Locator", "Event-Driven"]
```

### State Management
```yaml
state_patterns:
  local_state:
    - "Component State (React Native)"
    - "StatefulWidget (Flutter)"
    - "@State (SwiftUI)"
    - "ViewModel (Android)"
  
  global_state:
    - "Redux/Redux Toolkit"
    - "BLoC Pattern"
    - "ObservableObject (SwiftUI)"
    - "StateFlow/LiveData (Android)"
  
  persistent_state:
    - "AsyncStorage (React Native)"
    - "SharedPreferences (Flutter/Android)"
    - "UserDefaults (iOS)"
    - "SQLite/Realm"
```

## Technology Stack Preferences

### Native iOS
- **Language**: Swift or Objective-C
- **UI Framework**: UIKit or SwiftUI
- **Data**: Core Data or SQLite
- **Networking**: URLSession or Alamofire

### Native Android
- **Language**: Kotlin or Java
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose or XML layouts
- **Data**: Room or SQLite
- **Networking**: Retrofit or OkHttp

### Cross-Platform
- **React Native**: JavaScript/TypeScript with native modules
- **Flutter**: Dart with widget-based UI
- **Ionic**: Web technologies with Capacitor
- **Xamarin**: C# with native UI

## Development Patterns

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based**: Organize by app features
- **Layer-Based**: Separate UI, business logic, and data layers
- **Modular Architecture**: Reusable modules and components
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency inversion and separation of concerns

### Performance Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Load content on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Proper image sizing and caching
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage patterns
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimize background processing

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Support for assistive technologies
- **Offline Support**: Graceful offline functionality
- **Platform Guidelines**: Follow iOS HIG and Material Design

## Quality Assurance
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and UI testing
- **Device Testing**: Test on multiple devices and OS versions
- **Performance Testing**: Memory, CPU, and battery usage
- **Security Testing**: Data protection and secure communication
