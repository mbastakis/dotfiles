# Specification Alignment Quality Gate

## Purpose
Ensures that all deliverables align with project specifications and requirements, maintaining consistency between planned and delivered functionality.

## Validation Criteria

### Requirements Alignment
- [ ] Deliverable addresses all specified requirements
- [ ] No scope creep beyond approved specifications
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Functional requirements are fully satisfied
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are addressed

### Specification Compliance
- [ ] Implementation follows architectural specifications
- [ ] API contracts match defined specifications
- [ ] Data models align with specification schemas
- [ ] User interface matches design specifications
- [ ] Integration points follow specification guidelines

### Documentation Consistency
- [ ] Technical documentation reflects actual implementation
- [ ] User documentation matches delivered functionality
- [ ] API documentation is accurate and complete
- [ ] Architecture documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Change documentation captures all modifications

### Stakeholder Requirements
- [ ] Business requirements are fully addressed
- [ ] User stories are completely implemented
- [ ] Stakeholder feedback has been incorporated
- [ ] Business rules are correctly implemented
- [ ] Compliance requirements are met

## Validation Process

### Automated Checks
```yaml
automated_validation:
  api_contract_testing:
    - "OpenAPI specification validation"
    - "Contract testing with Pact"
    - "Schema validation"
    - "Response format verification"
  
  code_analysis:
    - "Static code analysis"
    - "Architecture compliance checking"
    - "Dependency validation"
    - "Security compliance scanning"
  
  documentation_sync:
    - "Code-documentation synchronization"
    - "API documentation generation"
    - "Specification drift detection"
    - "Change impact analysis"
```

### Manual Review
```yaml
manual_validation:
  specification_review:
    - "Requirements traceability matrix"
    - "Specification coverage analysis"
    - "Gap identification and resolution"
    - "Stakeholder sign-off verification"
  
  implementation_review:
    - "Code review against specifications"
    - "Architecture review and validation"
    - "Integration testing verification"
    - "User acceptance testing results"
```

## Quality Metrics

### Alignment Metrics
- **Requirements Coverage**: Percentage of requirements implemented
- **Specification Compliance**: Adherence to technical specifications
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Consistency between docs and implementation
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Approval ratings from stakeholders

### Threshold Criteria
- Requirements coverage: ≥ 95%
- Specification compliance: ≥ 90%
- Documentation accuracy: ≥ 95%
- Stakeholder satisfaction: ≥ 85%

## Remediation Actions

### Non-Compliance Response
1. **Identify Gaps**: Document specific alignment issues
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate impact of non-compliance
3. **Remediation Plan**: Create plan to address gaps
4. **Implementation**: Execute remediation activities
5. **Re-validation**: Verify compliance after remediation

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular specification reviews and updates
- Stakeholder feedback integration
- Process improvement based on lessons learned
- Tool and automation enhancements

## Integration with BMad

### BMad Workflow Integration
- Embedded in story validation processes
- Required for epic completion
- Integrated with quality checkpoints
- Part of definition of done criteria

### Agent Coordination
- **Product Owner**: Validates business requirement alignment
- **System Architect**: Verifies technical specification compliance
- **Quality Assurance**: Conducts comprehensive alignment testing
- **Business Analyst**: Ensures stakeholder requirement satisfaction

This quality gate ensures that all deliverables maintain strict alignment with specifications, preventing scope drift and ensuring stakeholder expectations are met.
