# Standards Compliance Quality Gate

## Overview

The Standards Compliance Quality Gate ensures all deliverables adhere to established organizational standards including coding standards, security requirements, performance benchmarks, and documentation standards.

## Validation Criteria

### Coding Standards Compliance (100% Required)
- **Style Guide Adherence**: Code follows established style guidelines
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent naming patterns across codebase
- **Code Organization**: Proper file and module organization
- **Documentation**: Adequate inline and API documentation

### Security Standards Compliance (100% Required)
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Implementation follows security guidelines
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: No high or critical security vulnerabilities
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper security controls implemented
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data properly protected

### Performance Standards Compliance (90% Required)
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Meets established performance targets
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of system resources
- **Scalability**: Design supports expected growth
- **Monitoring**: Performance monitoring implemented

### Documentation Standards Compliance (95% Required)
- **Completeness**: All required documentation present
- **Accuracy**: Documentation reflects actual implementation
- **Clarity**: Documentation is clear and understandable
- **Maintenance**: Documentation update process defined

## Validation Process

### Automated Validation
```yaml
automated_checks:
  code_style:
    - linting: "eslint, prettier, or equivalent"
    - formatting: "consistent code formatting"
    - complexity: "cyclomatic complexity within limits"
  
  security:
    - static_analysis: "SAST tools (SonarQube, CodeQL)"
    - dependency_scan: "vulnerable dependency detection"
    - secrets_scan: "no hardcoded secrets"
  
  performance:
    - load_testing: "performance under expected load"
    - memory_usage: "memory usage within limits"
    - response_time: "API response times acceptable"
```

### Manual Validation
```yaml
manual_reviews:
  code_review:
    - architecture_alignment: "follows architectural patterns"
    - business_logic: "correctly implements requirements"
    - error_handling: "proper error handling implemented"
  
  security_review:
    - threat_modeling: "security threats identified and mitigated"
    - access_controls: "proper access controls implemented"
    - data_flow: "secure data handling throughout system"
  
  documentation_review:
    - completeness: "all required sections present"
    - accuracy: "documentation matches implementation"
    - usability: "documentation is useful for intended audience"
```

## Quality Metrics

### Compliance Scoring
- **Overall Compliance Score**: Weighted average of all compliance areas
- **Critical Issues**: Number of critical compliance failures
- **Improvement Trend**: Compliance improvement over time
- **Time to Compliance**: Time required to achieve compliance

### Compliance Thresholds
```yaml
thresholds:
  passing:
    overall_score: 90%
    critical_issues: 0
    security_score: 100%
    performance_score: 85%
  
  warning:
    overall_score: 80%
    critical_issues: 1-2
    security_score: 95%
    performance_score: 75%
  
  failing:
    overall_score: <80%
    critical_issues: >2
    security_score: <95%
    performance_score: <75%
```

## Remediation Process

### Issue Classification
- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, major performance issues
- **High**: Standards violations affecting functionality
- **Medium**: Style guide violations, minor performance issues
- **Low**: Documentation gaps, minor formatting issues

### Remediation Timeline
- **Critical Issues**: Must be resolved before proceeding
- **High Issues**: Resolve within 1 business day
- **Medium Issues**: Resolve within 1 week
- **Low Issues**: Resolve within 2 weeks

### Escalation Process
1. **Developer**: Initial remediation attempt
2. **Tech Lead**: Review and guidance if needed
3. **Architect**: Architectural guidance for complex issues
4. **Quality Team**: Process improvement recommendations
