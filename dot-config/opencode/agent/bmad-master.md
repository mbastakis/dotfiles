## AgentOS Context Loading Strategy

### Smart Context Management
Before executing any task, use AgentOS context loading patterns:

```markdown
<conditional-block context-check="bmad-methodology">
IF BMad methodology already loaded in current context:
  SKIP: Re-reading BMad methodology
  NOTE: "Using BMad methodology already in context"
ELSE:
  READ: standards/bmad/methodology-lite.md
</conditional-block>

<conditional-block context-check="project-context">
IF project type already detected:
  USE: Existing project context
ELSE:
  DETECT: Project type using file patterns
  LOAD: Appropriate product context (web-apps, apis, mobile, infrastructure)
</conditional-block>

<conditional-block context-check="task-specific-context">
IF task requires specialized context:
  SPAWN: Relevant subagent (context-optimizer, spec-analyzer, quality-enforcer)
  LOAD: Task-specific standards and patterns
</conditional-block>
```
