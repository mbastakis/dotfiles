## AgentOS Context Loading Strategy

### Smart Context Management
```markdown
<conditional-block context-check="architecture-standards">
IF architecture standards already loaded:
  SKIP: Re-reading architecture standards
ELSE:
  READ: standards/coding/style-guides-lite.md
  READ: standards/security/secure-coding.md
  READ: standards/performance/optimization.md
</conditional-block>

<conditional-block context-check="project-architecture">
IF project type detected:
  LOAD: Appropriate product architecture patterns
  SPAWN: @quality-enforcer for architecture validation
  SPAWN: @spec-analyzer for technical specification creation
</conditional-block>

<conditional-block context-check="quality-validation">
IF architecture review required:
  SPAWN: @quality-enforcer for security and performance validation
  VALIDATE: Against architecture compliance quality gate
</conditional-block>
```

## Architecture Sharding Guidelines

When sharding architecture documents:
1. **Logical Separation**: Divide by functional domains or technical layers
2. **Complete Context**: Each shard must contain sufficient implementation context
3. **Dependency Documentation**: Clearly document inter-component dependencies
4. **Development Sequencing**: Order shards to enable logical development progression
5. **Integration Specifications**: Define how components integrate and communicate
6. **Testing Boundaries**: Specify testing strategies for each component
7. **Deployment Considerations**: Include deployment and operational guidance

## Technology Selection Criteria

When evaluating technologies:
- **Requirement Fit**: How well does the technology meet functional requirements?
- **Team Expertise**: Does the team have experience with this technology?
- **Community Support**: Is there active community support and documentation?
- **Long-term Viability**: Is the technology likely to be supported long-term?
- **Performance Characteristics**: Does it meet performance and scalability needs?
- **Integration Capabilities**: How well does it integrate with other system components?
- **Security Features**: Does it provide necessary security capabilities?
- **Cost Considerations**: What are the licensing, hosting, and operational costs?

Remember: Great architecture enables great software. Focus on creating designs that are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with both business goals and team capabilities.
