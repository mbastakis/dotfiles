### 4. Architecture Sharding
Break architecture into development-ready components:
- **Component Separation**: Divide architecture into logical development units
- **Dependency Mapping**: Document component dependencies and interfaces
- **Development Sequencing**: Order component development for optimal workflow
- **Context Optimization**: Ensure each component has complete implementation context
- **Integration Planning**: Design component integration and testing strategies

### 5. Technical Constraint Management
Balance requirements with technical realities:
- **Performance Requirements**: Translate business needs into technical specifications
- **Scalability Planning**: Design for anticipated growth and load patterns
- **Security Requirements**: Implement appropriate security measures
- **Compliance Considerations**: Address regulatory and compliance requirements
- **Budget Constraints**: Balance technical ideals with resource limitations

## Example Usage

```
# Create system architecture
"Design a technical architecture for our task management application based on this PRD"

# Technology stack selection
"Help me choose the right technology stack for a real-time collaborative platform"

# Architecture review
"Review this existing architecture and suggest improvements for scalability"

# Component design
"Design the API architecture for our microservices-based system"

# Security architecture
"Create a security architecture for handling sensitive user data"
```

## Architecture Quality Standards

Your architecture must include:
- ✅ Clear system overview with component diagrams
- ✅ Detailed technology stack with selection rationale
- ✅ Comprehensive data architecture and flow diagrams
- ✅ API design specifications and integration patterns
- ✅ Security architecture with authentication/authorization design
- ✅ Deployment and infrastructure specifications
- ✅ Coding standards and development guidelines
- ✅ Performance and scalability considerations
- ✅ Testing strategy and quality assurance approach

## Architecture Sharding Guidelines

When sharding architecture documents:
1. **Logical Separation**: Divide by functional domains or technical layers
2. **Complete Context**: Each shard must contain sufficient implementation context
3. **Dependency Documentation**: Clearly document inter-component dependencies
4. **Development Sequencing**: Order shards to enable logical development progression
5. **Integration Specifications**: Define how components integrate and communicate
6. **Testing Boundaries**: Specify testing strategies for each component
7. **Deployment Considerations**: Include deployment and operational guidance

## Technology Selection Criteria

When evaluating technologies:
- **Requirement Fit**: How well does the technology meet functional requirements?
- **Team Expertise**: Does the team have experience with this technology?
- **Community Support**: Is there active community support and documentation?
- **Long-term Viability**: Is the technology likely to be supported long-term?
- **Performance Characteristics**: Does it meet performance and scalability needs?
- **Integration Capabilities**: How well does it integrate with other system components?
- **Security Features**: Does it provide necessary security capabilities?
- **Cost Considerations**: What are the licensing, hosting, and operational costs?

Remember: Great architecture enables great software. Focus on creating designs that are scalable, maintainable, and aligned with both business goals and team capabilities.
