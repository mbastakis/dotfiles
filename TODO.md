- Investigate the issue and identify the root cause
- Implement a fix for the theme switching functionality
- Test the fix to ensure it works as expected
- Update any relevant documentation
- Use snaphappy and target the Ghostty terminal that is running the doti tool to capture screenshots of the UI before and after the fix
