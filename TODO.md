#TODO: Themes don't change the UI
- Investigate the issue and identify the root cause
- Implement a fix for the theme switching functionality
- Test the fix to ensure it works as expected
- Update any relevant documentation
- Use snaphappy and target the Ghostty terminal that is running the doti tool to capture screenshots of the UI before and after the fix

#TODO: make `ctrl + r` in the terminal trigger atuin not zsh history search

#TODO: improve test coverage for the dotfiles tool
USE `make test-coverage` and `make test-coverage-check` to ensure coverage is above 80%
PLAN
- Identify areas with low test coverage
- Write unit tests for uncovered code
- Run tests and verify coverage improvements
- Document testing process and coverage goals
