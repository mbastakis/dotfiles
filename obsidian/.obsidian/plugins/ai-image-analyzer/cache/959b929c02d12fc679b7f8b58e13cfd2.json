This algorithm comes into play when the different costs are available for each edge of the graph. The primary goal of the uniform cost search is to find a path to the goal node which has the lowest cumulative cost. Uniform-cost search expands nodes according to their priority queue and, by default, any generated node becomes a child of the existing most important node. It does not care about the number of steps involved in searching, and only stops when it finds the goal node. Due to this, its algorithm may be stuck in an infinite loop","libVersion":"0.2.0"}
