- Add login-mtr.yml with MTR registry authentication templates
- Support automated versioning with version-manager.sh
- Enable secure, efficient container builds across all AICC projects

These templates replace Docker-in-Docker with Kaniko for better security and performance.

- Replace Docker-in-Docker with Kaniko-based builds for better security and efficiency
- Push all images to MTR registry (mtr.devops.telekom.de/aicc-llm-assistant/magenta-apprentice)
- Add automated versioning with version-manager.sh script
- Add build jobs for all services: backend, frontend, agent-gateway, apa-web-bench, evaluator
- Keep Artifactory for PyPI dependencies, use MTR for container images
- Add release jobs that trigger on git tags and create -latest tags
- Reuse templates from aicc/infrastructure/cicd-templates

Images will be tagged as:
- Dev builds: {service}-{version}-dev.{sha}
- Releases: {service}-{version} + {service}-latest
