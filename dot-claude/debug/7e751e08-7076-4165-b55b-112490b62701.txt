fix: increase ClickHouse memory limit to prevent OOM crashes

ClickHouse was crashing with memory limit exceeded errors:
- Previous limit: 512Mi (from "small" preset)
- Actual usage: ~804Mi
- New limit: 1.5Gi with 1Gi request

This also fixes the langfuse-web pod crashes which were caused by
inability to connect to the crashed ClickHouse instance.
