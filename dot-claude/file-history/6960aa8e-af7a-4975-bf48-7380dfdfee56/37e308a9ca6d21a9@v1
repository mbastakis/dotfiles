## Project Overview

This is a GitLab group containing multiple repositories for a Kubernetes-based application platform. The structure is divided into two main areas:

- **`fiber/`**: Application code repositories (Fiber is the use case/application layer)
- **`infrastructure/`**: Infrastructure and platform support repositories
- **`specs/`**: Specifications and documentation

## Index

This is a gitlab group for all the repositories in a project. 
It contains the following repositories at the top level:

./fiber : A gitlab subgroup for all fiber related repositories. Fiber is a use case so essentially the application code.
./infrastructure : A gitlab subgroup for all infrastructure related repositories. Infrastructure is everything that supports the application code.

For now we are working in the dev environment. The dev environment is a kubernetes cluster in aws. For the dev environment we have the following repositories:
- ./infrastructure/argocd/root-app-of-apps: This repository contains the argocd application for the root app of apps. This is the entry point for argocd root app of apps, In each different environment. We care only about dev for now.
  - ./infrastructure/argocd/dev-core-kubernetes-infra-app-of-apps: This is the root app of apss for the dev environment and especcially for core kubernetes infra services. This are the shared services which are used by all the applications. Contains:
  Keycloak, labelstudio, langfuse, n8n etc.
  - ./infrastructure/argocd/helm-charts: This is a gitlab subgroup. It contains all the helm charts for the applications and services we use for the dev-core-kubernetes-infra-app-of-apps.

./infrastructure/iac/aws: This repository contains the terraform code for the aws infrastructure.
  ./infrastructure/iac/aws/eks: This repository contains the terraform code for the eks cluster.
  ./infrastructure/iac/aws/iam: This repository contains the terraform code for the iam roles and policies.
  ./infrastructure/iac/aws/k8s-core: gitlab_group_access_token, argocd, argocd_project, karpenter etc.

./fiber/argocd/dev-root-fiber-app-of-apps: This is the root app of apps for the dev environment and especially for fiber applications. This contains all the fiber applications.
  - ./fiber/argocd/helm-charts: This is a gitlab subgroup. It contains all the helm charts for the fiber applications.
./fiber/magenta-apprentice: This repository contains the code for the magenta apprentice application. This is our main application. The helm charts for this application are in ./fiber/argocd/helm-charts/magenta-apprentice-helm 


---

./docs/ : This folder contains all the documentation related to the project. This is an ai managed directory. You can add any documentation you want here. You can create subfolders and files as you want. The documentation is in markdown format.

./qa/ : This folder contains all the qa related files. This is an ai managed directory. You can add any qa related files you want here. You can create subfolders and files as you want. The qa files are in markdown format.

./specs/ : This folder contains all the specifications related to the project. This is an ai managed directory. You can add any specifications you want here. You can create subfolders and files as you want. The specifications are in markdown format.

## Tools
You have access to the aws cli
You have access to the kubectl cli
You have access to the helm cli

---

You shall run kubectl and aws commands to understand the current state of the cluster and the aws account and debug.

---

Most of the things you do should be as code and not manual. You can create terraform code, helm charts, kubectl manifests etc.
When you want to deploy a change you shall ask me.

---

Use to gain access to the aws account, keep in mind this is a global script, you need to use this before any aws command, you can use this command from any directory:
```
source aws-switch-profile.sh dev
```
